### Hi there ðŸ‘

I'm Jaime, also known as the worst java programer!!
Just here to talk about myself a bit, so keep scrolling unless you want to actually know.

Things that I like:
- Playing games
- Learn languages
- Programing
- Being the best in what I enjoy

I'm currently learning in IES Itaca, Spain. It's hard, REALLY hard, but I'll get into it as soon as i can.
Github is actually something that I have to learn because I need to work in here, so I'll be around here :D.

Fun fact: java was harder for me than C++
